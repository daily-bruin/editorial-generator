# Growl ü¶Å 

Growl is an internal tool used by the Daily Bruin staff to generate downloaded poll quotes from the Editorial Board. It was created so staffers don't have to manually create the graphics they use to source and saves time doing so.

## Installation

All you need to do is `git clone` this repo by running the following code in your terminal and it will create a directory named "Growl" for you:

`git clone https://github.com/daily-bruin/growl.git`

Now simply run either `npm start` or `yarn start`.

Sweet! Now the app is running in your browser at `localhost:8080`. Go check it out!
