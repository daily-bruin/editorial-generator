Growl is an internal tool used by the Daily Bruin staff to generate downloaded poll quotes from the Editorial Board. It was created so staffers don't have to manually create the graphics they use to source and saves time doing so.

## Installation

All you need to do is `git clone` this repo by running the following code in your terminal and it will create a directory named "growl" for you:

`git clone https://github.com/daily-bruin/growl.git`

Make sure you have all the required dependencies by running `npm install` while inside the `growl` directory.

Now simply run either `npm start` or `yarn start`, depending on your preference.

Sweet! You just compiled Growl!

Because of Cross-Origin Errors and some browsers blocking the download of files which require compilation, you cannot use the "Get Image" function of Growl on your local machine. To get around this, we recommend you download [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/), which creates a small server running at `localhost:3000` you can use to serve your files. 

### Browsersync

First, run `npm install -g browser-sync` to install the module on your computer.

Now, making sure you're in the `growl` folder, run:

`browser-sync start --server public/`.

This will create and redirect you to port 3000, where you can accurately test Growl.

`package.json` defines what the command `npm start` should actually do, which is to:

1. run the gulpfile to compile the SASS into CSS and move the `index.html` file into the public directory, where the user will see it
2. use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) to compile all the JavaScript files (including dependencies) into one main file called `bundle.js`
